Project Title: Password-Complexity-Checker

The "Password-Complexity-Checker" is a Python script designed to evaluate the strength of user-provided passwords. It analyzes various factors to ensure that passwords adhere to key security standards, aiming to promote stronger cybersecurity habits.

 Key Features:

1.Password Length: Ensures the password contains at least 8 characters.
2. Uppercase Letters: Verifies the presence of at least one uppercase letter.
3. Lowercase Letters: Confirms the inclusion of at least one lowercase letter.
4. Numbers**: Checks if the password contains at least one numeric digit.
5. Special Characters: Requires at least one special symbol from the set (!@#$%^&*()-+=).

 Strength Assessment:

- Feedback: The script provides immediate feedback based on the password's compliance with the above criteria.
- Weak Passwords: If any requirement is not met, the password is labeled as "Weak," and the missing elements are clearly identified.
- Strong Passwords: When all conditions are met, the password is classified as "Strong," ensuring it meets fundamental security requirements.

How It Works:

- Input: Users are prompted to enter their password when running the script.
- Evaluation: The script assesses the password against the specified criteria.
- Feedback: Users receive real-time feedback, highlighting weaknesses and offering suggestions for improvement.

 Purpose:

- Password Assessment: This tool offers a quick, reliable way for users to test the strength of their passwords.
- Educational Tool: It raises awareness about the essential components of a secure password, helping users make informed choices.
- Enhanced Security: By encouraging stronger passwords, the script supports better overall cybersecurity practices.
